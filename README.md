# deepgrad
DeepGrad is a from-scratch deep learning framework built in pure Python â€” no NumPy, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.  It includes a custom autograd engine, tensor library, and optimizer (Adam), and trains a neural network on the MNIST dataset with up to 98% accuracy. Designed for learning, transparency, and extensibility.
